# MZFlood

A nicer, smoother implementation of the [Flood Fill puzzle game from Simon Tatham's Portable Puzzle Collection](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/puzzles/js/flood.html).

Powered by [Flutter](https://flutter.dev).

## Features

- Smooth UI and visuals
- **Grid size** and **palette size** customization â€” non-square rectangular grids are also supported
- **Flood-fill point position** customization: any corner, any side, the very center, or even random if you like
- Hiding the color panel (you can tap the cells on the grid itself to flood-fill)
- Optional slow **flood-fill effect** (can be tweaked or even disabled if you prefer good old instant flood-fill)
- **Monochrome more** support (grayscale and tint color)
- Color palette's saturation, brightness, and contrast customization
- **Color Accessability Mode** support (mark cells with numbers)
